(Its an hour outside of Knoxville. Her parents: Bipp, was offshore blowing things up in the South Pacific; and mother Mary, institutionalized, was quite absent for the entirety of her childhood. Anyway, her life was always pretty austere, for the first two years of her life, she would cry nonstop, could read at four, confessed to synesthesia at seven. StellaMae was taken to the ophthalmologist in Knoxville, who first suspected her of "being crazy". By this point StellaMae was already able to tell time. She says, "It was wintertime" and that she ".. loved the winters.”  She kept odd hours, ..”staying up late to scribble calculations on a yellow notepad, playing her fiddle at all hours of the night, and staring vacantly into space.” At the age of 10, StellaMae learned to ride horses and developed a life-long love of New Mexico after horse packing through the Sangre de Christo and Jemez Mountain Ranges. Intrinsically, StellaMae was a loner, and spent much of her time out in the wild, riding the desert.")][Random shit :D Likes=StellaMae curses a lot..

If you break little promises, youll break big ones.” Medication, drugs, horses being mistreated. hates unwelcomed touch, sexual advances, catcalling. Stupid questions. Physical sports, knows jack-shit about it despite her polymathy. Eccentricities= can read backwards. She can read something in a mirror. Who is that? Leonardo? She can write a paper so that the margins are justified. Not the contents necessarily. So that each line comes out the same length as the one before, while typing, as if it were printed.
